    <p>Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
    <br>I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
    <br>I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
    <br>I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more</p>

    <p>I got the horses in the back, horse tack is attached
    <br>Hat is matte black, got the boots that's black to match
    <br>Ridin' on a horse, ha, you can whip your Porsche
    <br>I been in the valley, you ain't been up off that porch, now</p>
    
    <p>Can't nobody tell me nothin'

    <br>Cowboy hat from Gucci, Wrangler on my booty</p>

    <br>You can't tell me nothin'
    <br>Can't nobody tell me nothin'
    <br>You can't tell me nothin'</p>
    
    <p>Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
    <br>I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
    <br>I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road 
    <br>I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
    <br>I got the hor</p>
